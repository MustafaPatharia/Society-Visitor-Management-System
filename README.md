<h3>Introduction</h3>
Our home is considered to be the safest place in the world. To ensure this, we make use of various methods such as biometrics, cameras, burglar alarms and so on in our homes. With modern technology and convenience, we receive several visitors daily for deliveries, servants, campaign promoters, etc. It is not easy to manage such a large number of visitors daily. So we require some automated process that ensures safety from people with malicious intent and provides us with a sense of security to us and more importantly to our loved ones. This is extremely important when teenagers or our elder ones are alone at home because they are the easy prey for intruders. Teenagers do not have the foresight to detect and analyze such situations and defend themselves when they are attacked. Elder people are mainly handicapped due to their old age and many health problems that they suffer from. So, here we discuss how we can ensure safety and monitor the flow of people in and out of our society and provide away of issue an alert in case of a situation.
